DPD Romania Courier shipping method plugin

== Description ==

= Overview =

This plug-in is intended to implement a new shipping method using the DPD Romania service. As a store owner, after installing the plugin, you are able to import the list of DPD Romania
service and delivery points assigned to your account. If your customer chooses the order to be delivered with DPD Romania, you will be able to see this in the list of commands in your store's
administration panel. You will also be able to create an AWB. You can then add a new parcel in the created AWB and show the AWB as a pdf format. If you want, you can show the AWB history or delete the AWB.
